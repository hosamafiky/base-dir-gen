This tool is designed to generate feature directories. It is specifically tailored for the current base of Awamer Elshabaka company.

## Getting Started

To use this tool, right-click on the folder where you want to create the feature and select "BaseDirGen: New Feature". Enter the feature name in snake_case format.
Additionally, if you want to create a feature with a stateful widget as the main page, you can use the "BaseDirGen: New Feature (stful)" command. Just like before, enter the feature name in snake_case format.
